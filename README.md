MCAD Web Development 1 Final Project -- Recreating JUCO Photo site
This is a project for the Web Development course at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. In this example, we dissect the JUCO Photo homepage, and then develop a simple component library from our study.
I created a replica of this site's homepage with my own code.
